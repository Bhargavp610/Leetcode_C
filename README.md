# LeetCode Solutions in C

A collection of my LeetCode solutions written in **C**, focused on building strong fundamentals in **data structures, algorithms, and low-level problem solving**.

This repo is intentionally C-only so I can practice:
- Pointer + memory management
- Efficient time/space tradeoffs
- Writing clean, readable C under interview constraints

---

## What You'll Find Here

- Solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems (easy → hard)
- Emphasis on correctness, performance, and clarity
- Helpful comments when a problem has a tricky idea (edge cases, invariants, etc.)

---

## Problem Topics

Common categories you’ll see:
- Arrays and Strings
- Hashing and Two Pointers
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs (BFS/DFS)
- Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy
- Backtracking
- Bit Manipulation

---

## Conventions

- Each solution is in its own file.
- File naming usually follows either:
  - `####-problem-name.c` (recommended), or
  - `problem-name.c`
- I prioritize:
  - clear function structure
  - edge-case handling
  - efficient runtime where it matters

---

## Progress Philosophy

I’m not just collecting answers. The goal is consistent practice on increasingly challenging problems and building the ability to explain:
- the approach
- complexity
- why it works

## Notes

If you spot a bug or a cleaner approach, feel free to open an issue or PR.
